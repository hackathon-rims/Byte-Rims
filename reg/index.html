            <h2>MACHINE LEARNING</h2>
            <p>
              Where to use Machine Learning? Not every problem which has numbers
              involved in it is a machine learning problem. Thereâ€™s a great
              saying, if the only tool you have is a hammer, you tend to see
              every problem as a nail. Machine Learning can only be used in the
              following problems: Learning from the data is required.

            <h3>CYBER SECURITY</h3>
            <p>
              The key to effectively tackling cybersecurity challenges lies in
              the interplay of technological advancement, education and
              awareness. The first step of the process is to admit that you are
              always at the risk of a cybersecurity threat.

            <h3>Blockchain</h3>
            <p>
              As safe as they may appear, blockchains are only as secure as
              their weakest link. For example, if someone wanted access to data
              shared within an exclusive blockchain, they only need access to
              one node in it. That means the device that is the easiest to hack
              in a blockchain is a threat to the privacy of the entire
              blockchain.
